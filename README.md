# Web-Services-for-Doctos-and-Patients
A Hospital system consists of Doctors and Patients services. While administering the system, there is a need for all operations like adding a doctor, retrieving the doctor details in different formats, updating the doctor and deleting the doctor. Similarly, for patient’s service all the four operations are also created. This is implemented using the RESTful web service called JAX-RS framework. Different URL’s are used for each service on server side. Some tools used for developing services are eclipse neon IDE, cURL utility, tomcat web server and a browser for viewing the output.
